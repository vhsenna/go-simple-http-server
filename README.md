# Go Simple HTTP Server

This project contains a simple Go HTTP server with three routes.

## Routes

1. **Root Route** (`/`): This route serves as the root of the application and responds with an `index.html` file.

2. **Hello Route** (`/hello`): This route calls the `hello` function, which prints "hello" to the screen.

3. **Form Route** (`/form`): This route is associated with the `form` function, which opens up a `form.html` file.
